go-fish
=======

Our first project at Coding Dojo. Using Node.JS we will build a simple Go Fish game

For the curious:
- This was an attempt to create a simple go fish game in node.js while learning node.js at the same time. Not express, JUST 
node.js. In one week. It was painful considering that nobody in our immdeeate circle was in the know on node.js. We were on 
our own.

- Suffice to say, we didnt complete it. The grand ending was managing to a working server and routing capablities. 
- For a noob, I consider that an accomplishment.
